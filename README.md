# Bharat-Intern_task-3_Iris-Flowers-Classification

This project aims to classify Iris flowers into different species using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains measurements of Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width for three different Iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Iris dataset, which is a popular dataset in machine learning. It consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples for each Iris species.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The dataset is explored to gain insights and understand the distribution of data. Various visualizations such as histograms, box plots, violin plots, and scatter plots are used to analyze the relationships between different features and the Iris species.

### Model Training and Evaluation
Several machine learning algorithms are implemented and evaluated for the Iris flower classification task. The algorithms used include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree. The accuracy scores of these models on the test data are as follows:

- Logistic Regression: 94.7%
- Support Vector Machines: 94.7%
- Naive Bayes: 94.7%
- K-Nearest Neighbors: 94.7%
- Decision Tree: 92.1%

### Conclusion
Based on the accuracy scores, all models performed well in classifying the Iris flower species. Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors achieved the highest accuracy of 94.7%. The Decision Tree model had a slightly lower accuracy of 92.1%.
